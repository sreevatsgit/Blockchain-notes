Hello People of this Universe 👋👋👋👋 
<br>
My name is Sreevatsan. I am a Web3 Developer from India currently living in Singapore. The world of Web3 and Blockchain is booming and everyone is losing their minds on where and how to start learning about this intresting piece of technology. Even I was in the same position but overcame it by reading a bunch of books📖, watching countless hours of Youtube Tutorials📹, making a bunch of errors in my code and finally harnessed everything related to blockchain development into this website! 
<br>
This website is a list of notes will be consistently updated as time goes on. Hence removing the doubt of "outdatedness"🙂🙂🙂  

These notes are primarily used to learn blockchain, solidity and a full stack web3 development using JavaScript. This documentation was created using Markdown, Dendron and Netlify. (Shout-out to Dendron💕🌱🌱 this is probably the best note taking software I have ever used!!)
