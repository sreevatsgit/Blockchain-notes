Hello People of this Universe 👋👋👋👋 
<br>
My name is Sreevatsan. I am a Web3 Developer from India currently living in Singapore. The world of Web3 and Blockchain is booming and everyone is losing their minds on where and how to start learning about this intresting piece of technology. Even I was in the same position but overcame it by reading a bunch of books📖, watching countless hours of Youtube Tutorials📹, making a bunch of errors in my code and finally harnessed everything related to blockchain development into this website! 
<br>
This website is a list of notes will be consistently updated as time goes on. Hence removing the doubt of "outdatedness"🙂🙂🙂  

These notes are primarily used to learn blockchain, solidity and a full stack web3 development using JavaScript. This documentation was created using Markdown, Dendron and Netlify. (Shout-out to Dendron💕🌱🌱 this is probably the best note taking software I have ever used!!)

Table of Contents:

1. [[Blockchain Basics]]
2. [[Setting Up a Wallet]]



## More About me 😎😎😎

Hello Blockchain Ethusiasts!

I'm Sreevatsan Komandur Sridhar (Or Sree). I am from Bangalore, India currently living in Singapore. I self-taught myself everything related to blockchain and love working with smart contracts. 
<br>
In the past I created a variety of applications on the blockchain like a voting machine that can give transparent elections to governments. I also created an ERC720 meme token known as "Iso-coin" to complete a funny dare given by my friends. I also created a couple of NFTs and gave them out as gifts. Currently I am working in also helping a couple of friends in upscaling their NFT projects as well. 
I love the concept of blockchain, but the problem is there are many people who still don't get the idea on how it works. Some of them also do not understand head or tail on when to start. That was the whole concept of this website (done on Dendron). It was to end meaningless debates, a cloud of confusion but most importantly learn what the actual heck is blockchain and how does it work.

Apart from my coding life, I love playing golf🏌️‍♂️, Dota 2, binge eating food 🍕🍕, watching YouTube videos and love teaching people the art to code🖥️🖥️🖥️🖥️.


This website gives a full arc on what a blockchain does, both the development side and the non-tech side! I would consistently update it and make it as enjoyable as possible!  Even if you dont know how to code a simple print statement, I know that this website would help you get a better grip on the concept of blockchain.
