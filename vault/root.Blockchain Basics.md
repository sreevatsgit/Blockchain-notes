## The Bitcoin
Bitcoin was one of the first protocol to use this revolutionary technology called blockchain. 
The bitcoin whitepaper outlined how it can make peer to peer transactions in a decentralized network.

This network was powered by cryptography and decentrality and allowed people to engage in censorship resistance to finance in a decentralized manner. Due to its features people took to this as a superior digital store of value and called it digital gold. 

Similar to gold there is a scarce amount or a set amount of bitcoin available on the planet only so much that you can buy and sell.  

## The Ethereum
Some people saw this technology and wanted to take it a step further. A few years later, Vitalik Buterin released a new protocol whitepaper known as ethereum which used the same blockchain infrastructure of Bitcoin with an additional feature which were decentralized agreements or **Smart Contracts.**

This allowed people to not only make decentralized transactions, but decentralized agreements, decentralized organizations and other ways to interact with each other without any centralized intermidiary governing force. 

## Defining a smart contract
A smart contract are a set of instructions that are executed in a decentralized way without needing a centralized entity (or third party intermidiaries) to run them.

Think smart contracts as "traditional contracts" or traditional agreements except that they aren't written in paper. Instead, they are written on code and are embodied and executed on the blockchain platform. 

However, even Bitcoin does have smart contracts. But they are intentionally Turing incomplete, meaning that they dont have all the functionality that a programming language will give them. Bitcoin developers viewed bitcoin as a store of value. On the other hand, Ethereum developers viewed ethereum as a store of value and as a feature that facilitates these decentralized agreements.
