## The Bitcoin Protocol
Bitcoin was one of the first protocol to use this revolutionary technology called blockchain. 
The bitcoin whitepaper outlined how it can make peer to peer transactions in a decentralized network. 
<br><br>
This network was powered by cryptography and decentrality and allowed people to engage in censorship resistance to finance in a decentralized manner. Due to its features people took to this as a superior digital store of value and called it digital gold. 

Similar to gold there is a scarce amount or a set amount of bitcoin available on the planet only so much that you can buy and sell.  

## The Ethereum Protocol
Some people saw this technology and wanted to take it a step further. A few years later, Vitalik Buterin released a new protocol whitepaper known as ethereum which used the same blockchain infrastructure of Bitcoin with an additional feature which were decentralized agreements or **Smart Contracts.**

This allowed people to not only make decentralized transactions, but decentralized agreements, decentralized organizations and other ways to interact with each other without any centralized intermidiary governing force. 

## Defining a smart contract
A **smart contract** are a set of instructions that are executed in a decentralized way without needing a centralized entity (or third party intermidiaries) to run them.

Think smart contracts as "traditional contracts" or traditional agreements except that they aren't written in paper. Instead, they are written on code and are embodied and executed on the blockchain platform. 

However, even Bitcoin does have smart contracts. But they are intentionally **Turing incomplete**, meaning that they dont have all the functionality that a programming language will give them. Bitcoin developers viewed bitcoin as a store of value. On the other hand, Ethereum developers viewed ethereum as a store of value and as a feature that facilitates these decentralized agreements.

## The Oracle Problem, and the Chainlink Protocol:
The smart contracts on the blockchain come with numerous benefits but with a big issue. If you want agreements in our everyday lives to be replaced by smart contracts we would require data from the real world. Blockchains by themselves cannot interact, read or even listen to the data coming from the real world. This problem is known as **"The Oracle Problem"**.
<br>
Blockchains are purposefully deterministic systems. Anything that happens with them, happens in their cute isolated little world. But if they are dealing with agreements they are going to definitely need external data and external competition. 

This is where the Oracles come into play. Oracles are devices that can deliver the data to these decentralized blockchain or runs external computation. But if we want the applications to be decentralized you can't work with just one Oracle. You would need a decentralized Oracle Network, similar to a decentralized blockchain. 
<br>
The on-chain logic maybe decentralized but you also need your off-chain and computation to be decentralized too.
Combining the on-chain decentralized logic with the offchain decentralized data and computation, is what gives rise to **hybrid smart contracts**. Hybrid Smart contracts typically has some random off-chain component.
<br>
This is where **Chainlink** comes into the picture. A decentralized oracle network that can bring the external data and external computation into your smart contracts and makes sure that it is decentralized end-to-end that we need for our contract agreements.

<br>
Chainlink really helps us construct or smart contracts in a meaningful way. 

<br>
<br>
Since the release of Ethereum, numerous blockchains came to life like Avalanche, polygon, harmony etc.

All these notes are mainly directed towards developing smart contracts using ethereum. But it will be applicable to the vast majority of networks and learning it in ethereum can enable you to switching chains and developing other smart contracts on other platforms easily!

A combination of many smart contracts is known as a Decentralized application or just **Dapp**.

So we know what is a smart-contract, a Dapp and different protocols so what the heck is a **web3**??????

## The iteration of Web!
We have seen the web develop more than 2 decades! Here is the evolution of the web:
<br>
- **Web1**: Persmissionless open source world that allows you to have static content.
<br>
- **Web2**: Permissioned web with dynamic content where all the agreements and logic off of centralized servers where they control your information.
<br>
- **Web3**: The permissionless web, with dynamic content where decentralized servers run the logic creating censorship resistant agreements in which smart contracts are enabled. Users own the protocol they work with and its often dubbed as the **ownership economy**.

## Why do I need a smart contract today?

A piece of tech is only good depending on the problem it solves. If it doesnt solve anything why have it in the first place??
In short, what smart contracts do is that they create **trust minimized agreements** and give rise to **unbreakable promises**.
<br>
Nearly everything we do in life is a result of an agreement contract or a promise.  When you're getting an oil change for your car from a company, they are promising that they will faithfully change your oil in exchange for money. Or you go to a bank where they promise you to keep your money safely in return to give out loans to others. Whenever we make one of these agreements in a way you asking them to "pinky-swear" into not screw you over and treat you fairly. (But it doesnt always happen).
<br>
### The McScam:
Let's take a real life example of a broken promise 😭😭😭😭. So we all know McDonalds and the fun game Monopoly. Back in the 90s, McDonalds ran a promotion to win a million dollar jackpot if they collect the McDonalds' Monopoly game cards. The idea was simple. You buy McDonalds and in return you get a promise from them where they give you and other customers a "fair" chance to win the $1M jackpot. Well, the 90s was a very gullible time and needless to say they broke the promise. Instead of a "fair chance" the chance was actually zero (lol). Over $24M went into the pockets of insiders who rigged the game. Meaning, if you were actually that gullible and you entered the McDonalds monopoly game you literally bought into the game into a set of lies and promises that are gonna be 100000000000% broken. They basically just stole $24M from them.
<br>
Now imagine. Same jackpot, but you deploy on a smart contract in the blockchain. Its gonna be impossible to get scammed due to smartcontracts being **immutable**, **decentralized**, **trustworthy** and **Transparent**.

So the blockchain eliminate the questions like: **"How can I trust them?"** or **"Will they break the promise?"**

The question of "trust" happens all the time.   
The issue with our current contracts is that we gotta trust the people who designed them to do the right thing. But most of the times, they just don't do the write thing.History is a relentless lesson of trustworthy entities being notorious promise breakers. The shady deals that lead to the 2008 recession, hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe and Brazil etc all led to problems due to trustworthy issues. We finally have a solution. **"Da Blockchain"** and **"Da Smart Contracts"**

A smart Contract:
- cannot be altered (immutable)
- Gets automatically executed
- Every single person views the terms and conditions
- impossible to hack, commit fraud and maipulate.

The code is practically executed by a decentralized collective like a group of people running a certain software. This means that no one person or entity can alter any of these agreements or change these terms of the arrangements. Its also impossible to hack it cause once a hacker enters into the system every single person in the server is notified.
In smart contracts, doing the right thing is infrastructural. 
<br>
Although this technology is new, we have seen it relandscape the entire markets and continue to do so. **Decentralized Finance** or De-Fi already have over $200 billion in these decentralized protocols to have **more fair**, **more accountable** and more **transparent** financial systems. We need to move away from where we are right now and end the chances of people's wealth being vaccumed by some random corporate group who are bending the rules to their favor. And smart contracts is the key to a better world. 

Apart from "trust" the blockchain gives us:
- security benefits
- uptime benefits
- Fast Execution speed

Other benefits:
1. It's decentralized (duh!): No centralized intermidiary
The different individuals that run one of these blockchains are known as **node operators**. The combination of all these 10s and 1000s of node operators running the same software, running the same algorithms and smart contracts that make the system decentralized.
2. Transparency and Flexibility: Since all these individual node operators run this software, everybody can see what is happening on chain. No shady deals!!! Anything that is seen unfair people can see it and then... just not use it lol. Everyone has the perfect information and has to play it by the same rules. However, you might be wondering, if its public, how the heck is there gonna be privacy? Well, the blockchain is psuedoanonymous, meaning that you aren't tied to an identity in real-life
3. ⚡Speed and efficiency: Ever tried an overseas bank transfer? It sometimes takes more than a week! But on the other hand these banks are doing just simple math.. Subract and adding balances. Why does it take so long? On the blockchain these happens instantly. This is obviously quicker and efficient
4. Security and immutability: Once a smart contract is deployed, it becomes immutable or not changed whatever in the code is in the code forever which means the security is a lot easier to maintain. In a centralized world someone can hack into a centralized server and change a few numbers. 
🕵️🕵️ If you're wondering how to hack the blockchain, well you gotta just take over about 1/2 of the total nodes. You do that well then Bob's your uncle (I beleive in you 😉😉😉)
